# Intro to Programming Final Project - Clue

You were invited to the mansion of Mr. Boddy for a dinner party. However, during the party, Mr. Boddy was discovered dead at the entrance of the house. It is your job to determine who did it, with what, and where. You will be competing against three other players. Each player will get 4 to 5 items and those items will not be part of the solution. The goal is to guess the person, weapon, and room that is missing.
