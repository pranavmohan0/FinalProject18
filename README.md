# Intro to Programming Final Project - Clue

There has been a murder at Magnet. The player assumes the identity of 1 of 6
characters and works to solve the muder by guessing the murderer, the murder
weapon, and the room in which the murder occurred. The player will make a guess
and then see how many of the 3 choices they made were correct but they will not
learn which choice was correct. They will continue to guess and get results until
they correctly guess the murderer, the weapon, and the room.
